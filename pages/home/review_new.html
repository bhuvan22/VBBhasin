                Dr. Bhasin explains the ailment, treatment, and his post-operative follow-up is just superb. Unlike other doctors, he is very patient and listens to all your concerns, addressing them in a very systematic manner. He gives ample time to each patient and is very professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                This comes from many years of experience as a surgeon. He did not even see my MRI and told me the problem just by looking at the knee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Bhasin is someone who will recommend surgery only if itâ€™s absolutely necessary. Even though surgery was required in my case due to a complete ACL tear, he suggested that I wait until the swelling subsided before getting the surgery done so that the knee does not get stiff.
            </p>
            <p>
                My surgery was performed by Dr. Bhasin at City Hospital, a unit of Gangaram Hospital, and went uneventfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                The procedure for taking appointments is very simple and managed professionally by Practo. I recommend that you see him at Westside Clinic, where he practices every day from 5 to 8:30 pm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish him good health and a long life. Thank you, Dr. V.B. Bhasin. God bless.

                I had ligament injury in 2004 and went for surgery in 2009. My knee was severely damaged and I was lucky to be in the safe hands of Dr. Bhasin. He is a firm believer in God, and that's why God blesses him with positivity. I underwent ACL reconstruction and meniscectomy, and he explained everything, even during the operation. Today I am active in sports and participate in all cricket league tournaments. God bless him for a long and healthy life because mankind needs him.
