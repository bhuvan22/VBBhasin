<!--          <h3>Patient Testimonial</h3>-->
          <h3>
            Dr. Bhasin explains the ailment, treatment, and his post-operative follow-up is just superb. Unlike other doctors, he is very patient and listens to all your concerns, addressing them in a very systematic manner. He gives ample time to each patient and is very professional.
          <br><br>
            This comes from many years of experience as a surgeon. He did not even see my MRI and told me the problem just by looking at the knee.
           <br><br>
            Dr. Bhasin is someone who will recommend surgery only if itâ€™s absolutely necessary. Even though surgery was required in my case due to a complete ACL tear, he suggested that I wait until the swelling subsided before getting the surgery done so that the knee does not get stiff.
          <br><br>
            My surgery was performed by Dr. Bhasin at City Hospital, a unit of Gangaram Hospital, and went uneventfully.
          <br><br>
            The procedure for taking appointments is very simple and managed professionally by Practo. I recommend that you see him at Westside Clinic, where he practices every day from 5 to 8:30 pm.
         <br><br>
            I wish him good health and a long life. Thank you, Dr. V.B. Bhasin. God bless.
          <br><br>
